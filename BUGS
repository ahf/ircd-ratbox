 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:

1.  /MODUNLOAD causes cores:
    - If a module is modified before being unloaded, /MODUNLOAD (and
      therefore /MODRELOAD) may cause a core.

      This problem is caused by the behaviour of the OS, which treats
      shared libraries differently to executables (modifying the ircd
      binary whilst it is running would also cause a core, but is denied
      by the OS).  There is no way to fix this at the application level,
      and fixing the OS to do the right thing is also difficult.

      A workaround to avoid coring is possible however.  To install new
      modules, first remove or rename the old module, then copy/move the
      new file into place.  /MODUNLOAD will then work successfully.

      Alternatively, running ./configure with the --disable-shared-modules
      argument will link all the commands statically, losing the advantages
      of upgrading at runtime, but reducing the chances of accidentally
      coring your server.

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug in by E-MAIL to ircd-ratbox@lists.ratbox.org

 Please include a gdb backtrace and keep your binaries, modules and core file
 in case the developers need more information.
