ircd-ratbox is an evolution where ircd-hybrid left off around version 7-rc1.  
Currently the ircd-ratbox team consists of the following developers:
 
AndroSyn, Aaron Sethman <androsyn -at- ratbox.org>
anfl, Lee Hardy <lee -at- leeh.co.uk>
jilles, Jilles Tjoelker <jilles -at- stack.nl>

Special thanks for support, code and ideas to:

dubkat, Daniel Reidy <dubkat -at- gmail.com>
Hwy, W. Campbell <wcampbel -at- botbay.net>
larne, Edward Brocklesby <ejb -at- sdf.lonestar.org>
 
Of course our work is based on the work of many, many others over the past
10 or so years since irc has existed, including the work done by the Hybrid
team, our thanks goes to them.
