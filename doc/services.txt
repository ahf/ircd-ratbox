- ratbox-services compatibility documentation - Lee H <lee -at- leeh.co.uk> -
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility with ratbox-services can be enabled by passing the
'--enable-services' flag to configure.  It will add the following features
to ircd:

- Channel mode +r -

   A simple mode taking no parameters, will require users are logged in
   with user services before they may join the channel.

   Gives numeric 477 to users who arent logged in:
   :<server> 477 <nick> <channel> :Cannot join channel (+r)

- service block to ircd.conf -

   Ability to specify the names of services servers in ircd.conf:
   service {
       name = "services.ircd-ratbox.org";
       name = "backup-services.ircd-ratbox.org";
   };

   These must be specified for certain features to work.  You may specify as
   many name entries as you wish, however you must define only one service
   block.

   Entries will be listed in stats U with the flag 's'.

- Services protection -

   Services will be protected from being deopped or kicked from a channel.

- Username tracking through netsplits -

   When users are logged in, the username they are logged in with will be
   preserved on a netsplit, so users will not have to relogin when the
   network merges together.

- Username given on WHOIS -

   When users are logged in, WHOIS will also give numeric 330:
   :<server> 330 <yournick> <targetnick> <loginname> :is logged in as

- Forced nick change -

   When using nickname services and a client requests they regain a
   nickname, services can perform a forced nick change on the client.
   This forcibly changes the clients nickname to the one they requested
   they regain, ensuring they can always regain their nickname.
