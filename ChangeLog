  Enable -Wformat checking on numerics.
  
  The replies array is gone, all the texts are now #defines in a new file
  include/messages.h. The form_str() function is now a macro that returns
  one of the strings. It only accepts constants (usually a RPL_* or ERR_*
  define from numeric.h).
  
  The three places that passed a variable to form_str() are a bit uglier
  now.
  
  Various problems are now visible in -Wformat; this commit does not fix
  them.

  This adds the extended formatting codes, which are useful for
  requesting only the necessary information (e.g. done by xchat/conspire
  for away status updates), and allow requesting the IP address
  (respecting usual rules) and services account name.
  
  As in charybdis, the oplevel (o) formatting code is supported in some
  way (only showing 999 or n/a) but not documented.
  
  Different from charybdis, the idle time (l) formatting code always
  returns 0 and is not documented. This is to ensure idle time hiding
  patches do not have to be changed.
  
  The extended selection flags and multiple nicks/channels are not
  supported; I consider these less useful and in practice they do not
  seem to be used much.

  This can happen harmlessly in particular if a SAVE

  Most commands use UID as prefix which does not have

  Add DNSBL support from charybdis.
  
  DNSBLs are checked when the USER message is received and prevent completing
  registration until done (this means that a CAP negotiation can be done in
  parallel with DNSBL lookups). A pending DNSBL lookup also prevents the
  unknown connection timing out. The result is checked at the same time as
  klines. Reject cache applies to blacklists as to klines. 
  
  There are no server notices, other than for invalid replies (not A or
  outside 127.0.0.0/8).
  
  The kline_exempt auth flag exempts from DNSBL checks, as does the new
  dnsbl_exempt flag. In either case, a notice is still sent to warn the user.
  
  The new /stats n shows blacklists and the number of hits since the last
  rehash.
  
  Since I do not know of any DNSBLs for IPv6, DNSBL checking is only done for
  IPv4 clients.
  
  Compared to charybdis, the preClient struct (to store things until
  registration) is not present in ircd-ratbox, so I put the DNSBL fields in
  localClient instead.
  
  I have not ported variable substitution in the reason; the reason field is
  just an exact string. Substitution can be useful to provide clickable URLs.

  - Check to see if certain warning flags are supported by the compiler and use them all the time
  - Add -fno-strict-aliasing to the list of flags passed, this seems to be needed for gcc 4.4 now
    as we end up breaking strict aliasing rules when doing a lot of things
  - Remove unneeded checks for rm etc as autoconf already checks these anyways
  - Rerun libtoolize to get a newer version of libtool
  - Rerun autotools

  Make it more likely that error messages on ssld connections get through.
  When ssld reports a connection closure because of
  "Remote host closed the connection" and the connection
  is any server or a registered client, try a

  This should mainly help LIBRB_USE_IOTYPE=poll which

  Add mask_match(), like ircu mmatch().
  This compares two masks and returns whether the "new" is

  with match() is that a '?' in "old" does not match a '*' in
  "new".
  The idea is as in charybdis, but this is a modified

  match().

  This adds an FNC token, and shows cmode +r if it is

  It goes through the list whenever a 005 is to be sent.

  Hold up the burst in server_estab until either the bottom of the function and we're done. 
  If the server has ziplinks enabled, set an event to pop the queue, otherwise pop it right away.  
  Its ugly, but it eliminates the race condition between ssld and the ircd as sometimes the command to enable ziplinks
  gets there after we've sent additional uncompressed data, making the other server get inflate errors.
